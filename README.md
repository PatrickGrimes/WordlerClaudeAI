An HTML page created by Claude to assist in solving Wordle problems.

This was created with the following prompt:

Create an application with a UI that I can run from within Microsoft Windows. It is meant to help with solving the New York Times daily Wordle. 
I need to be able to add in letters that are in the correct position, letters that are in the incorrect position and letters not contained in the word. 
I have no preference on technology.
